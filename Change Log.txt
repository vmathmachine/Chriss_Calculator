The text selection mechanism was finished.

New matrix functions were added (such as eigenrow, eigencolumn, diag, etc).

Fixed a bug whereby some button presses weren't registered (especially if pressed in rapid succession).

Fixed a bug where press-and-hold functionality would get temporarily disabled for seemingly no reason.

Synchronized fonts so as to allow all applicable characters to render.

Added labels for 3D graphing.
