Text selection through highlighting was added. Double tap text to highlight it (which also brings up the text selection menu), triple tap to bring up the text selection menu w/out highlighting. It is planned that, in the next update, you will also be able to highlight text by way of the press-and-hold gesture.

A graphing bug was fixed. The bug being that certain discontinuous functions, such as y=e^(1/x), will fail to render parts of it. In the case of e^(1/x), the branch that goes to 0 will intermittently render and then not render. Now, however, it should always render.

A few extra functions for arrays were also added, such as splicing, searching, etc.

The code has also been refactored to generate text quicker and more efficiently.
