****Math's Machine****

Supported on Android, Windows, and Linux.

**To run on Android:**

From the browser on your Android device, navigate through this GitHub page "Executables" > "Android" > "maths_machine_release.apk", then press the 3 dots and download the file. Your browser might warn you that this file is harmful. It's not. Tap the downloaded file (if you don't know where it is, try using your file explorer of choice and navigate to "Downloads", then find the file and tap it). Open with PackageInstaller. It might warn you about Google not recognizing the developer. Press "more options", and then press "install anyway". The app "Maths_Machine" will now be a part of your app library. You may delete the downloaded apk file after you are done installing, if you'd like.

Alternatively, you may download the code by pressing the green "Code ▼" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Then, after unzipping, open the unzipped folder and navigate "Executables" > "Android" > "maths_machine_release.apk", and tap "maths_machine_release.apk" to install. You may delete the downloaded folder after you're done installing, if you'd like.

To update the app, repeat the above process (whichever of the 2 ways you prefer) for the most recent version of the app (or whichever version you'd like to update to), then open it to install it. It will ask if you'd like to update the app, you press yes, and it will update. To downgrade the app, you do the same thing, but download the apk for the earlier version you'd like to downgrade to.


**To run on Windows (64-bit):**

Download this code by pressing the green "Code ▼" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Then, after unzipping, open the unzipped folder, open "Executables", then find "Windows". Place the "Windows" folder somewhere secure where you won't accidentally delete it. Feel free to rename the "Windows" folder. You may also feel free to delete the folder "Maths_Machine" and the ZIP file "Maths_Machine.ZIP", provided that you do not delete the "Windows" folder (or whatever you rename it to).

To open the application, please double tap "Maths_Machine.exe". You may not remove this file from that folder, as that will prevent the application from properly reading saved calculator history and imported assets; it won't turn on. You may, however, create a shortcut for "Maths_Machine.exe" and place that on your desktop (or wherever you'd like).

To update the app, repeat the above process, but for the newest version of the code. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the old "Windows" folder was renamed to "Calculator 1", and this one "Calculator 2". In that case, delete the folder "saves" from the "Calculator 2" folder. Then, look at the folder "saves" in "Calculator 1", and copy it to inside the "Calculator 2" folder. Now, if you'd like, you may delete the "Calculator 1" folder. If you previously made a shortcut for the old version of Math's Machine, you'll have to delete it and replace it with a shortcut for the new version. What you've done here, by the way, is effectively just replaced the application with a newer version of it, and transferred over all the save data.


**To run on Linux (64-bit):**

Download this code by pressing the green "Code ▼" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Then, after unzipping, open the unzipped folder, open "Executables", then find "Linux". Place the "Linux" folder somewhere secure where you won't accidentally delete it. Feel free to rename the "Linux" folder. You may also feel free to delete the folder "Maths_Machine" and the ZIP file "Maths_Machine.ZIP", provided that you do not delete the "Linux" folder (or whatever you rename it to).

To open the application, please double tap "Maths_Machine" from your file explorer. Depending on your settings, this will either run the application, try to run the application, or open it as a text document. In case 1, we have no issues. In case 2, please modify this folder to have executable permissions and try again (this is done by either opening properties > permissions > check the box saying "allow executing file as program", or going into terminal and using chmod 777 on it). In case 3, please try right clicking and seeing if there is an option to run as an application. If there isn't, instead open the terminal from this directory and enter the command "./Maths_Machine". You may not remove the file "Maths_Machine" from its current folder, as that will prevent the application from properly reading saved calculator history, the compatibility code, and imported assets; it won't turn on. You may, however, create a shortcut for "Maths_Machine" and place that on your desktop (or wherever you'd like).

To update the app, repeat the above process, but for the newest version of the code. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the old "Linux" folder was renamed to "Calculator 1", and this one "Calculator 2". In that case, delete the folder "saves" from the "Calculator 2" folder. Then, look at the folder "saves" in "Calculator 1", and copy it to inside the "Calculator 2" folder. Now, if you'd like, you may delete the "Calculator 1" folder. If you previously made a shortcut for the old version of Math's Machine, you'll have to delete it and replace it with a shortcut for the new version. What you've done here, by the way, is effectively just replaced the application with a newer version of it, and transferred over all the save data.

The reason this is so big is to ensure compatibility. If you think you can export it as a smaller application, feel free to open the open source code in Processing IDE and take a whack at it. If you succeed, please feel free to tell me at chrismaguschak@gmail.com


**To run on Mac (64-bit):**

I swear to god I don't know.

I'm not a Mac user, and my only friend who owns a Mac isn't great with computers, so...I think the Mac version works? But, I honestly don't know if or how it does. If it does, it probably works similarly to how it does for Windows and Linux in the above descriptions.


**Misc**

Tap * twice for the ^ symbol. Tap the ▼ to bring up the keyboard (on mobile).


For detailed information on how to use this application, please check out the manual, "Math Machine Manual.txt".

To view differences between this version and the previous version, please view the "Change Log.txt".

To view and/or edit the code, Please check out the "Open Source Code" folder.



If your application crashes on mobile, it will copy a crash report to your clipboard (this feature will also soon be added to the PC version). If your calculator crashes, please send this crash report (unedited) to chrismaguschak@gmail.com, with the subject "Maths_Machine crash report". Thank you!

**Credits**

Credit goes to the Processing Foundation for their free, open source graphics library and IDE, which were used to develop this application for both PC and Android.
Processing was used for development as, since it has both a regular Java mode and an Android development mode, this allowed for both the PC and mobile application to be written with mostly the same code, allowing for cross-platform parity.

This code was written by Christopher Maguschak, GitHub username "vmathmachine".
