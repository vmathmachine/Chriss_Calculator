****Math's Machine****

Supported on Android, Windows, and Linux.

**To run on Android:**

Open the folder "Executables", open "Android", download  "maths_machine_release.apk" to your Android device. Tap the downloaded file. Open with PackageInstaller. It might warn you about Google not recognizing the developer. Press "more options", and then press "install anyway". The app "Maths_Machine" will now be a part of your app library.

To update the app, you download the apk for the most recent version of the app (or whichever version you'd like to update to), then open it to install it. It will ask if you'd like to update the app, you press yes, and it will update. To downgrade the app, you do the same thing, but download the apk for the earlier version you'd like to downgrade to.


**To run on Windows (64-bit):**

Open the folder "Executables". Download "Windows" to your Windows device. Place the folder somewhere secure, where you won't accidentally delete it. Feel free to rename
it. To open the application, please double tap "Maths_Machine.exe". Feel free to create a shortcut of "Maths_Machine.exe" to open and close this whenever you'd like.

To update the app, you download the new version of this application. Then, in the OLD folder "Windows" (or whatever you renamed it to), copy the "saves" folder to the NEW folder
"Windows". Doing this transfers all of your old data to the new, updated version. Replace your old shortcut with a shortcut for the new "Maths_Machine.exe". When you're sure that
your new version works, you may delete the old "Windows" folder and its contents.


**To run on Linux (64-bit):**

Open the folder "Executables". Download "Linux" to your Linux device. Place the folder somewhere secure, where you won't accidentally delete it. Feel free to rename it.
To open the application, please give "Maths_Machine" executable permissions and run it. Feel free to create a shortcut that runs the executable file.

To update the app, you download the new version of this application. Then, in the OLD folder "Linux" (or whatever you renamed it to), copy the "saves" folder to the NEW folder
"Linux". Doing this transfers all of your old data to the new, updated version. Replace your old shortcut with a shortcut for the new "Maths_Machine". When you're sure that your
new version works, you may delete the old "Linux" folder and its contents.

**Credits**

Credit goes to the Processing Foundation for their free, open source graphics library and IDE, which were used to develop this application for both PC and Android.
Processing was used for development as, since it has both a regular Java mode and an Android development mode, this allowed for both the PC and mobile application to be written with mostly the same code, allowing for cross-platform parity.

This code was written by Christopher Maguschak, GitHub username "vmathmachine".
